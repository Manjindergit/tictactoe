# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe as part of the Project Odin assignment. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Challenge your friends to a game of Tic Tac Toe.
- **Interactive Game Board**: Click on the grid to make your move.
- **Game Status Display**: Keep track of whose turn it is and who has won the game.

## How to Play

1. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
2. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marker.
3. The first player to get 3 of their markers in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 markers in a row, the game is a draw.


Enjoy the game!
